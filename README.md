Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo.



Once we figured out how toa ctually do this, we had a pretty easy time. The fact that one of out team members wasnt around really helped to simulate a real world situation, where we might not be able to directly interact with one another, and instead have to communicate via slack and or GitHub. 

There were a lot of issues with push and pull timing. I think the largest part of the issue was how the instructions were read and then executed. 

Other issues that were around was who merged when and pulled where. On the fourth round we had a nice and easy time.
